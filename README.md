# Berry Big Trouble

## Overview
Berry Big Trouble is an AR-powered Unity game where you play as a little bear collecting and eating fruits while avoiding and fighting off enemies. Inspired by Pac-Man, the game challenges you to survive as long as possible, using power-ups to turn the tables on your foes.

## Gameplay
- **Player:** Control a bear in an AR environment.
- **Objective:** Collect all the fruits (blueberries, strawberries, apples) to win.
- **Enemies:** Bees and bats chase the player. Contact with them is fatal unless they are vulnerable.
- **Power-up:** Collecting a blueberry makes enemies vulnerable for a short time.
- **Game Over:** Touching an enemy (when not vulnerable) ends the game.

## Game Flow
1. **Main Menu:** Start or Quit.
2. **Gameplay:** Collect fruit, avoid/fight enemies.
3. **Game Over (Loss):** Triggered by enemy contact. Options: Return to Menu or Quit.
